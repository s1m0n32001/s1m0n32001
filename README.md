Physics graduate with a background in statistical physics and deep learning. 

### Some projects I have worked on in uni
  - **Sparse-view 3D reconstruction using Latent Diffusion Models**: Thesis project carried out during a six-month internship at SONY SL1 in Stuttgart.
  - **HMM for protein state reconstruction**: Implementation of the Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms to train a Hidden Markov Model on the single-molecule time trace of an Hsp-90 protein ([read our paper here!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19207))
  -  [Bayesian SIR](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/BayesianSIR): Bayesian inference on the SIR parameters to model the spreading of Covid infections in 2020.
  - [Parallel implementation of k-means using PySpark](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/kMeansMapReduce): PySpark based parallel implementation of the ```kmeans++``` algorithm on a small VM cluster
 -  [Percolation ML](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/PercolationML): Learning the critical parameters of the DP model with simple Auto-Encoders. Implemented the method described in the [paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.052140) by Shen et. al. and applied it to the Domanyi-Kinzel model.
  - [Image colorization using CNNs](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/Colorization)
  - [Fake News recognition using Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/BayesianFakeNewsRecognition)
  - [Traveling Salesman Problem via Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/TSP-Art): First coding project ðŸ¥º C++ implementation of scale-based Simulated Annealing to find approximate solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Applied it to [Robert Bosch's Art Datasets](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/data/art/)
