### Hi there!
I'm a Physics student, currently taking my master's in **Physics of Data** at University of Padova, Italy. 

### Some projects I have worked on:
  - [Parallel implementation of k-means using PySpark](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/kMeansMapReduce): group project as part of a course in Management of Physical Datasets
  - HMM for protein state reconstruction: we implemented the Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithm to train a Hidden Markov Model on the single-molecule trajectory of an Hsp-90 protein
  - [Fake News recognition using Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/BayesianFakeNewsRecognition): group project for a course in Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis
  - [Game of Life](https://github.com/RiccardoTancredi/GameofLife): Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life (group project)
  - [Traveling Salesman Problem via Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/s1m0n32001/TSP-Art): C++ implementation of scale-based Simulated Annealing to find approximated solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Applied it to [Robert Bosch's Art Datasets](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/data/art/)
